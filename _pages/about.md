Since September 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation (LPSM)](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) with [Etienne Roquain](https://etienneroquain-81.webself.net/). I am also a membre of the [MARS project](https://etienneroquain-81.webself.net/mars).

Prior to that, I was a postdoc in the probability and statistics team of the Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay (LMO) with Sylvain Arlot. I was also a member of the INRIA Celeste team. I completed a PhD at ENS Paris-Saclay in 2021 entitled Multivariate analysis with tensors and graphs - application to neuroscience, under the supervision of Nicolas Vayatis, Laurent Oudre, and Julien Audiffren.
